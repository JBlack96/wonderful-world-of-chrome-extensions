Creating a basic step by step guide for putting together your first Chrome Extension

Throughout the repo we will look at the building blocks of what is required to start making a chrome extension. Once we have a basic understanding we will look too add a couple of very basic functioning logs running in different areas of the browser. Once this has been established we will look at how we can utilise a function within the devtools to analyse web requests - the importance of this to SaleCycle can't be understated since it's the foundation that the implementation team rely on for their day to day jobs.
